Subject: [PATCH] disable fseeko usage on 32-bit Android older than API 24

feesko is not supported on 32-bit Android older than API 24 [1].
Older SDKs would allow the call but the 64-bit off_t was not accurate.
With the NDK26 the call is hidden in that case and calling fseeko() results in a compilation error.
